Remember to check everything twice before the first power up, especially polarities!

Ajout diagramme

Note: You can trust the colors of the cables in the diagram, but be aware that the color of the cables of the stepper motors can change from one manufacturer to another, the order of the colors of your stepper motors can therefore be different from the diagram. On my motors, the colors correspond to: A +, A-, B +, B- Check the specifics of yours.
