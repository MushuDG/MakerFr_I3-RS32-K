### Important Note üìå

The colors of the cables in the diagram can generally be trusted. However, the color order of stepper motor cables may vary depending on the manufacturer. Please ensure that the color sequence of your stepper motors matches the diagram or the pinout provided.

### Display Wiring

Connect the two EXP ports (EXP1, EXP2) to the TFT35 as shown in the diagram below:

## Jumpers Configuration üîß

### UART Mode of TMC Driver

If you're using TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225, or similar drivers, ensure the jumpers are placed as shown in the diagram below. The microsteps and current settings can be configured within the firmware.

![UART_TMC_Mode](https://github.com/MushuDG/MakerFr_I3-RS32-K/blob/main/Pictures/1_Wiring/TMC_Drivers_Jumpers.png)

### Driver Voltage Selection

Select the appropriate driver voltage according to your configuration needs. Use the following diagram as a guide:

![Drivers_Voltage_Selection](https://github.com/MushuDG/MakerFr_I3-RS32-K/blob/main/Pictures/1_Wiring/Drivers_Voltage.png)

### CNC Fan Voltage Selection

You can set the output voltage for the CNC fan to 24V, 12V, or 5V by adjusting the jumper cap accordingly.

## Additional Steps ‚úÖ

Once everything is wired and set up, the power supply should start up, and the 40mm fan in the case should begin to spin, indicating that the system is powered on correctly.

To proceed with the installation of the CB1 OS, please follow the instructions in the [CB1 OS Installation Guide](https://github.com/MushuDG/MakerFr_I3-RS32-K/blob/main/Documentation/2_CB1_OS_Installation.md).
