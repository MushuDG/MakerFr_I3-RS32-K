# Stepper Motor Configurations
########################################
# Each stepper motor section defines the control of the motors that move the X, Y, Z axes, 
# and the extruder. These settings include pin assignments, microstepping, rotation distance,
# and endstop configurations.
[stepper_x]
# The X axis controls the movement of the extruder head left and right.
# These pins define which physical connections on the MCU control the stepper motor.
step_pin: PC8  # Pin controlling the stepper motor's steps.
dir_pin: PC9  # Pin controlling the direction of the motor.
enable_pin: !PA15  # Inverted pin (! symbol inverts the signal).
# Microstepping allows for smoother movement by breaking full motor steps into smaller increments.
microsteps: 16
# rotation_distance is the distance the motor moves with one full step. This value is crucial
# for ensuring the printer moves the correct distance per motor rotation.
rotation_distance: 32
# Endstop pin is the physical pin connected to the X-axis endstop, which tells the printer
# when the extruder has reached the home position.
endstop_pin: !PD3
# position_min sets the minimum possible position for the X axis. A negative value means the 
# extruder can move slightly past the defined zero point.
position_min: -11
# position_endstop defines the exact location where the X axis stops during homing.
position_endstop: -11
# position_max is the maximum allowed position for the X axis.
position_max: 200
# homing_speed is the speed at which the X axis moves during the homing process.
homing_speed: 60

[stepper_y]
# The Y axis controls the movement of the print bed forward and backward.
# The configuration follows the same logic as the X axis.
step_pin: PA10
dir_pin: !PA14
enable_pin: !PA13
microsteps: 16
rotation_distance: 32
endstop_pin: !PD2
position_min: -3
position_endstop: -3
position_max: 215
homing_speed: 60

[stepper_z]
# The Z axis controls the vertical movement of the print head (up and down).
# Slower speeds and finer control are necessary for accurate layer height adjustments.
step_pin: PC6
dir_pin: PC7
enable_pin: !PA9
microsteps: 16
# A smaller rotation distance on the Z axis provides more precise control over the vertical movement.
rotation_distance: 8
# The Z axis uses a probe (like a BLTouch) instead of a mechanical endstop for homing and bed leveling.
# The virtual endstop is used here to handle this.
endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop
position_min: -1
position_max: 210
homing_speed: 6  # Much slower speed for Z axis to ensure precise leveling.

[stepper_z1]
# In dual Z-axis setups, a second Z motor ensures that the bed remains level during printing.
# This configuration mirrors the first Z axis.
step_pin: PB12
dir_pin: PB11
enable_pin: !PA8
microsteps: 16
rotation_distance: 8

[extruder]
# The extruder motor controls the filament feed into the hotend.
step_pin: PB0
dir_pin: PB1
enable_pin: !PC4
microsteps: 16
# The rotation distance affects how much filament is extruded for each step of the motor.
# This must be calibrated to ensure proper extrusion.
rotation_distance: 6.01
# nozzle_diameter and filament_diameter are used to calculate extrusion rates. 
# Most printers use a 0.4 mm nozzle and 1.75 mm filament.
nozzle_diameter: 0.400
filament_diameter: 1.750
# max_extrude_only_distance limits how far the extruder can push filament when not moving 
# to prevent filament jams.
max_extrude_only_distance: 150
# heater_pin defines the pin controlling the extruder heater.
heater_pin: PC5
# The thermistor (temperature sensor) type and pin used to measure the temperature of the hotend.
sensor_type: EPCOS 100K B57560G104F
sensor_pin: PA2
# Temperature limits for the extruder. The minimum and maximum temperatures must stay within 
# safe ranges for the filament and printer hardware.
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 250
# PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) tuning for maintaining stable extruder temperatures.
# These values help regulate the heater to avoid temperature fluctuations.
