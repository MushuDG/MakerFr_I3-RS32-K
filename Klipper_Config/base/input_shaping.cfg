# Description:          
#   Configuration file for input shaping in the 3D printer firmware.
#   Input shaping is used to reduce vibrations and resonance during high-speed printing, 
#   resulting in smoother prints and better surface quality.

[input_shaper]
# Input shaping compensates for vibrations that occur when the print head moves rapidly 
# or changes direction. These vibrations, caused by mechanical resonance, can degrade 
# print quality by introducing artifacts such as ringing (ghosting) on the printed object.
# Proper tuning of input shaping settings can help achieve faster print speeds without 
# sacrificing quality.
shaper_freq_x: 29         # Resonance frequency for the X-axis (in Hz). Measured using a 
                          # resonance testing process or accelerometer.
shaper_freq_y: 32         # Resonance frequency for the Y-axis (in Hz). Same measurement process as above.
shaper_type: ei           # The "EI" input shaper type is a good default. It provides a balance 
                          # between vibration reduction and print speed.

# Notes:
# - Adjust these settings based on the results of a resonance test for your specific printer setup.
# - If input shaping is enabled, it's recommended to set `square_corner_velocity` to 5.0 in the main configuration file.
# - Refer to the Klipper documentation for details on resonance testing and compensation:
