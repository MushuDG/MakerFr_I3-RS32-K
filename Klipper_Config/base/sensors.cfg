########################################
# Bed Heater Configuration
########################################

# This section defines the control pin, temperature sensor type, and PID settings for maintaining
# stable bed temperatures.

heater_pin: PA5  # Microcontroller pin that powers the bed heater.
sensor_type: EPCOS 100K B57560G104F  # Specifies the thermistor type used for temperature measurement.
sensor_pin: PA0  # Pin connected to the thermistor to read bed temperature.

# Define the minimum and maximum operating temperatures for the bed.
min_temp: 0  # Prevents operation below 0Â°C to avoid false readings or sensor errors.
max_temp: 130  # Maximum temperature to prevent overheating and potential damage to the bed.

# Enable PID control for stable temperature regulation.
control: pid  # Uses a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller for precise temperature control.
pid_kp: 62.19  # Proportional gain.
pid_ki: 2.14  # Integral gain.
pid_kd: 453.0  # Derivative gain.

########################################
# Fan Configuration
########################################
# Fan configurations for cooling the printed part and preventing hotend overheating.

[fan]
# General part cooling fan for improving print quality, particularly on overhangs and bridges.
pin: PA4  # Pin controlling the fan's operation.
max_power: 1.0  # Maximum power output (100% fan speed).
shutdown_speed: 0  # Fan stops when the printer is idle or not actively printing.

[heater_fan heatbreak_cooling_fan]
# Heatbreak cooling fan prevents heat creep by cooling the upper part of the hotend assembly.
pin: PA3  # Pin controlling the heatbreak fan.
heater: extruder  # The fan activates when the extruder's heater is in use.
heater_temp: 0.0  # Fan starts running when the extruder temperature exceeds ambient levels.
fan_speed: 1.0  # Fan operates at full speed when the heater is active.

########################################
# BLTouch Configuration
########################################
[bltouch]
# Configuration for the BLTouch auto bed leveling probe, a retractable sensor that measures
# the distance between the nozzle and the bed at various points to ensure a level printing surface.

sensor_pin: PC13  # Microcontroller pin connected to the BLTouch sensor signal.
control_pin: PC15  # Pin controlling the probe's deployment and retraction.

# Offsets define the distance between the probe and the nozzle in each axis.
x_offset: 25.5  # The probe is located 25.5 mm to the right of the nozzle.
y_offset: 1  # The probe is located 1 mm in front of the nozzle.
z_offset: 0.5  # The calibrated Z offset ensures the nozzle is positioned at the correct height.

# Probe speed and behavior settings.
speed: 5.0  # The speed (in mm/s) at which the probe moves during leveling.
set_output_mode: 5V  # Configures the BLTouch to operate in 5V mode, required for compatibility.
pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: True  # Ensures the sensor accurately reports its state when retracted.
stow_on_each_sample: False  # Prevents the probe from being retracted between each sample point, speeding up the process.
probe_with_touch_mode: True  # Enables touch mode for more accurate and consistent measurements.

########################################
# Notes
########################################
# This configuration ensures precise control of the bed heater and fans, as well as reliable
# bed leveling using the BLTouch probe. Adjust offsets and PID values based on your specific hardware.
# Verify BLTouch wiring and functionality before enabling these settings.

########################################
# BIQU MicroProbe v2 Configuration
########################################
# This section configures the BIQU MicroProbe v2, an automatic bed leveling probe.
# The probe uses a retractable mechanism to measure the bed surface and ensure a level print area.

########################################
# G-code Macros for Probe Control
########################################

#[gcode_macro PROBE_DOWN]
## Macro to deploy the probe for bed leveling or measurement.
#gcode:
#    SET_PIN PIN=probe_enable VALUE=1  # Activates the pin controlling the probe, deploying it.

#[gcode_macro PROBE_UP]
## Macro to retract the probe after bed leveling or measurement.
#gcode:
#    SET_PIN PIN=probe_enable VALUE=0  # Deactivates the pin controlling the probe, retracting it.

########################################
# Output Pin Configuration
########################################

#[output_pin probe_enable]
## Configures the output pin used to enable or disable the probe.
#pin: PC15  # Specifies the control pin on the microcontroller for the probe mechanism.
#value: 0  # Default state of the pin (probe is retracted at startup).

########################################
# Probe Sensor Configuration
########################################

#[probe]
## Configures the probe's behavior and settings for automatic bed leveling.

#pin: ^!PC13
## The pin connected to the probe signal line.
## The caret (^) indicates a pull-up resistor is enabled for the pin.
## The exclamation mark (!) inverts the logic, as the probe signal is active-low.
## NOTE: For MicroProbe v2 users, change this to ^PC13 if your board requires a low-level trigger.

#deactivate_on_each_sample: False
## Keeps the probe deployed throughout the entire leveling process, speeding up probing.

#x_offset: 25.5
## The horizontal distance (in mm) between the nozzle and the probe in the X-axis.
## Positive values indicate the probe is to the right of the nozzle.

#y_offset: 1
## The horizontal distance (in mm) between the nozzle and the probe in the Y-axis.
## Positive values indicate the probe is in front of the nozzle.

#samples: 2
## The number of measurements taken at each probing point.
## Multiple samples improve accuracy by averaging out potential sensor noise.

#samples_tolerance: 0.05
## The allowed deviation (in mm) between consecutive samples at the same probing point.
## If the difference exceeds this value, the probe retries the measurement.

#samples_tolerance_retries: 3
## The maximum number of retries allowed if the sample deviation exceeds the tolerance.

#activate_gcode:
#    PROBE_DOWN
#    G4 P500
## G-code to deploy the probe when starting the probing sequence.
## Includes a 500ms delay (`G4 P500`) to ensure the probe is fully deployed before use.

#deactivate_gcode:
#    PROBE_UP
## G-code to retract the probe after completing the probing sequence.

########################################
# Notes
########################################
# - Ensure the probe's control and signal pins are correctly wired to the microcontroller.
# - Calibrate the X and Y offsets based on your printer's physical setup.
# - If using a BIQU MicroProbe v2 on a custom board, verify the signal polarity
#   and adjust the `pin` value (^!PC13 or ^!PC14) as required.
# - Test probe functionality with manual deploy/retract commands before performing a full bed leveling.
